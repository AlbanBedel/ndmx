         NanoDMX - A generic DMX device for dimmers and relays


This project attempts to create an affordable platform for custom DMX devices.

* Hardware

The hardware platform will be based on the popular AVR micro-controller and
should be easy to build at home. The schematics of the first reference hardware
are still beeing worked on.

* Software

The firmware is written for GNU gcc using avr-libc and should be portable to
most AVR providing an UART. To build:

 - Edit board_config.h to match your hardware configuration
 - Run: make MCU=mcu F_CPU=XXX with the proper MCU name and frequency
 - Flash your device with ndmx.ihex
